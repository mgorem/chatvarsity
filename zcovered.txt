// What I learnt from building this chat applicatiion:
- Creating a new Flutter Application
- Connecting to firebase services
- Building UI for the chat Application:
    -- Login page with firebase authentication
    -- Creating a homepage with user contacts
    -- Making a profile page that updates Firebase Firestore Information
    -- Building the chat message page


// Notes:


----------Setup on Android Studio:
- New flutter project on Android Studio Bumblebee
- Confirm SDK Path
- Enter Desired Project name(small letters)
- Select all desired platforms (android, ios, web)
- That creates a Flutter starter project.

----------Connecting to Firebase Services:
- navigate to firebase.google.com
- Enter project name-disable google analytics, Create project.
- Add firebase core plugin, i.e from root of the project run:
    > firebase pub add firebase_core

- Run Flutter CLI command. It depends on Firebase CLI (check https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)
  to setup firebase cli.
    you can do:
        > curl -sL https://firebase.tools | bash
        
        - This script automatically detects your os, 
        downloads latest Firebase CLI release, enables the globally available firebase command.

        > firebase login

        - Login and test the firebase CLI

        > firebase projects:list

        - Test that the CLI is properly installed and accessing your account by listing your 
        Firebase projects.

        // Optional- Updating to the latest CLI version
        > npm install -g firebase-tools
- Run 
    > dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli

to activate flutterfire cli.

- Run 
    > flutterfire configure

to choose the Firebase Project you've created.
(This creates a firebase_options.dart file in project structure).

- In main.dart file, you need to edit the main() function and ensure 
  WidgetFlutterBinding is initialized and then initialize Firebase like this:

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp(
    options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
  );
  runApp(MyApp());
}
- Ready to use flutter and all its services.
